I remember the first time I read the syllabus and feel so strange about everything because it is not like a traditional class. 
Instead of writing a long history paper, we finished all the work by using fun digital tools. 

In the beginning, I really doubt myself whether I can finish these tasks because there are so many programmes I've never heard of and used before.
However, when I actually started setting up programmers and followed by the instruction step by step, I realized it was not that hard as I imagined.
And I did learn lots of computer things for six weeks.

One of the digital tools I found was really interesting is the sonification. 
It can translate the data into the form of the sound spectrum and play it with different instruments. 
The trend of the sound spectrum is the same as the trend of data. 
I think it is a very useful tool because sonification representing data as non-speech sound, 
and it allowed people to know what does the data sound like. 
A brilliant feature of sonification is for people with visual impairments. 
Representing data and information in multiple ways is a critical issue that should be considered in the digital region, 
and people with disabilities have an equal right to enjoy the convenience brought by technology.


I encountered so many difficulties throughout six weeks, and some of them are still with me today. 
To be specific, I downloaded Anaconda successfully but I just can't open R studio, and I tried many times like re-download Anaconda,
and the R studio still doesn't work for me. So my way to solve this problem to use another laptop which has a Microsoft system. 
Most of the difficulties happened in the first few weeks that I was not familiar with terminal, and python. I always fail to run the code asked by professor
and I traced back to see where I've got wrong and found out that one more or one less 'space' could lead the wrong result. Therefore,
coding required me to be careful of what I am typing. And it is not a type of work that I just simply press the enter key to create digital work.
What's more, I can easily finish the example task provided by the professor, but the work from last week required me to choose my own example.
Choosing my own resources and apply them by using the techniques is much more complex than weekly tasks. To be specific, I wasn't sure which code should I type,
and I still need a lot of practice and a longer time to gain deeper learning experiences. 

Another essential thing I learned from digital history is teamwork.The discord platform helped me to learn skills from classmates' problems. And I tried my best to answer other's question from this class. I believe the value of learning digital history was to share information and experiences with others. It is useless when only me or a small group of people who know what to know. The more people share knowledge with others, the more contribution we made to digital history and even the world. 

In conclusion, I really enjoying taking this class, and it is definitely the most interesting and special class I have ever take.
Things I have learned from this class would actually help me in my future study and career. This class also inspired me to explore history and digital world.
And every mistakes I made helped me to gain experiences and do better next time.  
I will evaluate myself a B.

Thank you Dr. Graham for the great term. If someone asked me what's the most interesting class you have ever take during your undergraduate year. I will say crafting digital history.
